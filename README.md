## Bill of Materials

### Sensors:

– 1x RC522 RFID reader and RFID-Tag

– 1x Keypad 

– 1x Rotary Potentiometer 

– 4x Infrared sensors + emitters (square perimeter) 

– 1x Passive Infrared sensor w/lens dome

– 1x Photoresistor

– 1x RHT03 Temperature + Humidity Sensor Module

– 1x Wi-Fi module (NodeMCU ESP8266)


### Actuators:

– 4x Green, 4x Orange LEDs

– 1x LCD Screen

– 2x 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motors

– 2x X113647 Stepper Driver Boards

– 1x DC Motor Fan


### Miscellaneous:

– 1x Arduino Mega 2560 (Microcontroller board)

– 1x External power supply board

– 1x big + 2x smaller Prototyping Breadboards

– Various Jumper Wires

– Various Resistors (1k)


## Web Application

1. Indoor Lights: 
	The indoor light in the house can be triggered to ON/OFF by clicking the button function. Another alternative to this is to use the Motion sensor inside the house to trigger indoor lights to come ON.

2. Garage Door: 
	The garage door can only be triggered to Open/Close from the Web Application, this is mainly because of security in the house.

3. Security Alarm: 
	For the purpose of securing the house for when the owners are off to work or even sleeping at night, we added functionality to set the perimeter alarm to Activate/Deactivate depending on the owner. The Activate function arms the alarm, so it can trigger the perimeter security alarm when being intruded. And the Deactivate disarms the perimeter security alarm, this could be done when the family is home during the day.
